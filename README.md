# 🎨 Image Bot

**Image Bot** is your personal imagination machine on Discord. Type what you see in your mind—Image Bot renders it in pixels. Fast, clean, and stylish. No logos, no fuss. Just text-to-image magic on demand.

## ⚡ What It Does

- 💬 `/image` — Describe anything. Watch it appear.
- 🔁 **Redo** — Roll the dice again, new image, same prompt.
- 🎨 **Like Variations** — Get alternate artistic takes.
- ❌ **Delete** — Clean up after yourself.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Add your bot token and client ID to `.env`:

   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
   CLIENT_ID=your-application-id
   ```

3. Launch the bot:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

Image Bot will globally register `/image`—accessible in any server it's invited to.

## ✨ Example

```bash
/image prompt: a haunted floating castle surrounded by purple fog and lightning
```

🖼️ Boom. The image appears. Tap the buttons to explore variants or try again.
