# 🖼️ Image Bot

Image Bot is a sleek, interactive Discord bot that transforms your words into vivid AI-generated images. With a global `/image` command and intuitive buttons, users can create, refresh, and explore visuals—no branding, no fuss.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Node.js v16.9.0 or later
- A Discord application with a bot token and client ID  
  [Create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

---

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-bot.git
cd image-bot
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Upload or create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
CLIENT_ID=your-application-id-here
```

Your `.env` file stores sensitive credentials and is automatically ignored from version control.

### 3. Run the Bot

```bash
node index.js
```

Once started, the bot will globally register the `/image` command. This may take up to 1 hour to appear.
